# **Functional Specification: Cookie Heist Maze Game**

---

## **1. Overview**
**Cookie Heist Maze** is a multiplayer browser-based game for two active players and multiple spectators. Players compete to collect cookies while avoiding traps in a maze, with fog of war for players and a global view for spectators. The game features endpoints to dynamically initialize and manage game instances.

---

## **2. Gameplay Mechanics**

### **2.1 Objectives**
- Players aim to collect **X cookies** (e.g., 10) to win the game.
- Players can sabotage their opponent by placing **trap cookies** that reduce the opponent's lives.

### **2.2 Player Mechanics**
- **Lives:** Each player starts with **N lives** (e.g., 3). A life is lost if a player collects a trap cookie.
- **Cookie Collection:** Normal cookies add **+1 point** when collected.
- **Trap Cookies:** Players can drop a trap cookie every **T seconds** (e.g., 10 seconds). 
  - Trap cookies glow briefly (e.g., 3â€“5 seconds) after being placed, making them identifiable.
  - After glowing, trap cookies are indistinguishable from normal cookies.

### **2.3 Cookie Spawning**
- **Normal Cookies:** Always **K cookies** (e.g., 5) present in the maze at a time. When a cookie is collected, another spawns in a random position.
- **Trap Cookies:** Dropped manually by players, limited by cooldown (T seconds). Players cannot place more than one active trap cookie at a time.

### **2.4 Fog of War**
- Players see only a small radius around their current position in the maze.
- Viewers have access to a complete, unrestricted view of the maze.

    - Cookie collection and spawning.
    - Trap placement and activation.
  - Use `gameId` to isolate game instances.

- **Channels:**
  - Player-specific updates for fog of war and HUD.
  - Global updates for the viewer screen.

### **5.3 Endpoints**
- `/maze/create`: Initializes game instance and returns links.
